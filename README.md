## Analyzing the Data
For this project, I answered the following questions:

- Which track generated the most revenue? which album? which genre?

- Which countries have the highest sales revenue? What percent of total revenue does each country make up?

- How many customers did each employee support, what is the average revenue for each sale, and what is their total sale?
